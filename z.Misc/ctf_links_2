LiveOverflow
http://liveoverflow.com/index.html
Probably the best resource to get started. LiveOverflow runs a YouTube channel that goes through different hacking challenges and explains things from the ground up for people with little to no hacking experience. Heard about a big hack in the news? LiveOverflow also takes those and explains how those attacks work so that you can understand it as well.

CSAW HSF
https://hsf.csaw.io/
A high school cyber security competiton made by NYU. While it used to mainly cover digital forensics topics (think FBI/crime-scene type security), it now covers other topics like binary exploitation. Just note that it only runs in September-October each year.

HSCTF
http://hsctf.com/
"a CTF designed by high schoolers for high schoolers" This year's HSCTF runs in May, but they have lots of practice problems if you'd like to get started now: https://jacobedelman.gitbooks.io/hsctf-3-practice-problems/content/.

CTF Writeups
https://github.com/ctfs
Found an old security competition/CTF and want to know how the problems were solved? This is a huge community-driven collection of write ups to CTF competition challenges for the past several years. Just don't rely on them too much - the more you try the problems yourself and the less you rely on the writeups, the better you'll get. Maybe look through some of them to learn how experienced CTFers solve these problems.
